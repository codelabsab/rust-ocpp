//! BootNotification
//!
//! The objective of this use case is to enable a Charging Station that is
//! powering up to register itself at a CSMS and provide the right state information.
//!
//! To be able to control Charging Stations connecting to a CSMS, Charging Stations
//! are required to send [`BootNotificationRequest`]. This request contains some
//! general information about the Charging Station.
