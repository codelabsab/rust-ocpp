//! # From OCPP Specification
//! Central System can request a Charge Point to unlock a connector. To do so, the Central System
//! SHALL send an UnlockConnector.req PDU.
//!
//! The purpose of this message: Help EV drivers that have problems unplugging their cable from the
//! Charge Point in case of malfunction of the Connector cable retention. When a EV driver calls
//! the CPO help-desk, an operator could manually trigger the sending of an UnlockConnector.req to
//! the Charge Point, forcing a new attempt to unlock the connector. Hopefully this time the
//! connector unlocks and the EV driver can unplug the cable and drive away.
//!
//! The UnlockConnector.req SHOULD NOT be used to remotely stop a running transaction, use the
//! Remote Stop Transaction instead.
//!
//! Upon receipt of an UnlockConnector.req PDU, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a
//! UnlockConnector.conf PDU. The response PDU SHALL indicate whether the Charge Point was able to
//! unlock its connector.
//! If there was a transaction in progress on the specific connector, then Charge Point SHALL
//! finish the transaction first as described in Stop Transaction.
//!
//! UnlockConnector.req is intented only for unlocking the cable retention lock on the Connector,
//! not for unlocking a connector access door.
